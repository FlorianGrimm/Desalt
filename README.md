# Desalt
Converts Saltarelle C# files and projects to TypeScript.

## History
The history of this project starts in the early 2000s while I was working at
Microsoft on the Excel Web Access project. I and my colleagues were tired of
writing and maintaining a large code base in raw JavaScript. I started looking
around for something to convert C# (which was our language of choice) into
JavaScript and found the work of a fellow Microsoftie, Nikhil Kothari. He had
written a tool called [Script#](https://github.com/nikhilk/scriptsharp). Over
the course of a few months, our team ported our existing raw JavaScript into
Script# code. We saw amazing productivity boosts since we could use Visual
Studio and C#, which were quite a bit more evolved and robust than the JavaScript
tools that were currently available. I also joined Nikhil Kothari's virtual
Script# team to implement new features.

I left Microsoft at the end of 2009 and joined [Tableau Software](http://tableau.com)
and repeated the same thing I had done at Microsoft - I helped port our existing
raw JavaScript to Script#, and saw the same benefits that we had seen on Excel.

Eventually the Script# project was abandoned (when Nikhil left Microsoft for
Google) and our team at Tableau moved to [Saltarelle](https://github.com/Saltarelle/SaltarelleCompiler),
which was designed to be a drop-in replacement for Script#, but added C# 5.0
language features.

In June 2015, Saltarelle was aquired by [Bridge.NET](http://bridge.net) but
compatibility with Saltarelle was not a design goal for the new project. We at
Tableau Software now faced a situation where we had a large code base using a
compiler that was no longer supported. Additionally, new code within Tableau was
being written predominately in TypeScript and we wanted a way to easily port our
existing Saltarelle-based code to TypeScript. Hence, Desalt, written in
my spare time over the course of several months.
